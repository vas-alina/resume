# React Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built with React that showcases a collection of my projects and images. It provides users with an easy-to-navigate interface for viewing images and getting more information about each project. The site features a beautiful and functional gallery where images and text are neatly aligned and easy to perceive.

## Features

1. **Image Gallery**:
   - The gallery allows users to view images with captions.
   - Images are displayed in a grid and scale up on hover.
   - When an image is clicked, a modal opens with a larger version of the image.

2. **Styling**:
   - Uses `styled-components` for component styling.
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes.
   - Elements are aligned at the bottom with text positioned beneath the images.

3. **Modularity**:
   - The gallery component is reusable and can be used with different sets of images.
   - Image constants are stored in separate files for easier management.

4. **Modal Window**:
   - A modal window to view enlarged images.
   - The modal closes when clicking outside the image.

## Technologies

- **React** — for building the gallery component and managing state.
- **Styled-components** — for styling components with CSS-in-JS.
- **Flexbox** — for aligning elements inside containers.
